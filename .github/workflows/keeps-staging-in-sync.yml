# This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Sync Main to Staging"
# It will run when there is a push to the "main" branch

# The job is named "sync-branch"
# It will run on the latest Ubuntu environment

# The first step checks out the code using the actions/checkout action

# The second step is named "Merge main(dev) -> staging"
# It merges the "main" branch into the "staging" branch
# - `type: now` does the merge immediately
# - `from_branch: main` is the source branch
# - `target_branch: staging` is the destination branch
# - `github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` provides access to the repo for merging
