name: CI New Branch
run-name: CI-Merge New Branch

# This is the CI New Branch Workflow.
# The purpose of this workflow is to automate the process of integrating (CI) code changes
# that are made on new branches or on pull requests targeting the 'develop' branch.
#
# The workflow is triggered in two scenarios:
# 1. When a new branch is created. This is triggered by the 'create' event.
# 2. When a pull request is opened that targets the 'develop' branch. This is triggered by the 'pull_request' event with the 'opened' type.
#
# The workflow consists of a single job: 'CI'.
#
# The 'CI' job:
# - Is defined in the separate '.github/workflows/ci.yml' file.
# - Runs every time the workflow is triggered, regardless of the specific event.
# - Represents the 'Continuous Integration' part of the workflow, where the code changes are built and tested.
#
# This setup ensures that code changes are always integrated and tested (CI) when they're made on a new branch or included in a pull request targeting 'develop'.
