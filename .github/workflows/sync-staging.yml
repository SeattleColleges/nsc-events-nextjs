# Workflow to sync main branch changes into staging branch.
# Triggered on pushes to main branch.
# Jobs:
# - CI-preSyncCheck: Runs CI checks on main branch.
# - sync-branch:
#   - Checks out staging branch
#   - Merges main into staging with --no-ff
#   - Pushes merged staging branch
# Merging with --no-ff creates a merge commit to track changes.
